# *JobHunt2019*

## Scope: 
52 year old male. Master's degree in Data Science (recent grad). 30 years experience as a defense contractor systems engineer. Out of work (retired) for three years but roaring and ready to get back into the work force. How long will it take (days, weeks, months... egads!) to find a new job? The purpose of this project is to create a visualization showing the results of the job hunt.

## Methodology: 
The dataset and visualizations will be developed in parallel. Work will be done in excel (data entry) and Tableau (visualizations).

***Date*** - (date). Either the date of the submitted job application (by me) or the date a potential employer initiated contact.<br>
***Source*** - (factor). The source of the contact as either direct (self-initiated), employer (potential employer ititiated), or the job fair or job service (indeed, monster, dice, ziprecruiter, etc) used to initiate contact.<br>
***Company*** - (character). Company Name. <br>
***Industry*** - (factor). The industry general type. **(TBR)**<br>
***JobTitle***<br>
***JobType***<br>
***CallFromEmployer***<br>
***CallDate***<br>
***Interview***<br>

# JobHunt2019

52 year old, Master's degree, 30 years experience as a defense contractor systems engineer. Out of work (retired) for three years but roaring and ready to get back into the work force. How long will it take (days, weeks, months... egads!) to find a new job? The purpose of this project is to create a visualization showing the results of the job hunt.
